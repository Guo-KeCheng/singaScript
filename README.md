# singaScript by SGStudioCode


The singaScript project consists of a development environment (SGStudioCode) for users to run, evaluate, and test singaScript, a custom-built programming language. SingaScript is a low-level programming language built on top of Python and it uses almost exclusively Singaporean slangs as keywords, making it a unique and fun way to program.

The singaScript development environment is perfect for those who are interested in learning a new programming language, and especially those who are interested in Singaporean culture and language. It is a great tool for educators, students, and hobbyists who want to learn programming in a fun and engaging way.


## What is SGStudioCode?

The SGStudioCode development environment includes an interpreter, a virtual singlish-speaking "tutor" Merli and a set of tools that make it easy for users to practice, run and test their singaScript coding prowess. The interpreter allows users to run singaScript code in real-time, while a custom compiler can convert singaScript code into Python bytecode, making it more efficient to run.
